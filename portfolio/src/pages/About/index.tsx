                            With a solid background in Information Systems, I have built a three-year career in the Information Technology sector, excelling as
                            a professor and front-end/back-end developer, delivering products of exceptional quality. Currently, I focus my expertise on UX/UI
                            and product design, accumulating over two years of solid and successful experience in this field.
                            <br />
                            Seeking to enhance my skills, I participated in the renowned UX Unic√≥rnio course by Leandro Rezende and Google's UX Designer
                            Professional course, where I gained expertise in conducting comprehensive field research and creating impactful solutions for web
                            and mobile products over two years. Throughout my journey, I have collaborated with various teams, which provided me with valuable
                            hands-on experience with the agile SCRUM process, ensuring continuous deliveries and systematic validation of all hypotheses and
                            proposed solutions. Additionally, I played a key role in product conceptualization, skillfully navigating between business needs and
                            user demands. I conducted a series of in-depth user tests to validate each stage of the product development process.
                            <br />
                            These experiences have given me a broad understanding of how to align business goals with user expectations, while continuously
                            refining my ability to deliver user-centered design solutions. I am excited to apply this expertise and ongoing dedication to drive
                            the success of challenging and engaging projects in the future.
